# Logan Quandt's Data Science Portfolio
This repository is meant to showcase the application of Data Science principles including but not limited to Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Preparation, Feature Engineering and Model building in Python and R.

The highlights of the Portfolio include the following:
 - Insurance Regression Project - Using a Kaggle dataset containing anonymous demogrpahic information, I applied multiple regression models to predict total health care claims.
 - Data Wrangling Project - Highlights the data wrangling process by collecting data from multiple sources (flat files, web scraping and API), cleaning the data, saving as SQL tables using SQLite 3 and visualizing all the data.
